## Preview
https://facinetm14.github.io/Odin_library/

## Technos
<ul>
  <li>Html</li>
  <li>Css</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

## Features
There's no database, the books are stored in an array : ```myLibrary```
<ul>
  <li>display all booksfrom the library</li>
  <li>add a new book</li>
  <li>delete a book</li>
</ul>

## Outcome
Throughout this project, I created a modal form using ```<dialog></dialog>``` ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog ) and utilized ```FormData``` class to process form data without having to submit the form, which might be very useful for sending http request to an API endpoint while building a SPA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) for example.
